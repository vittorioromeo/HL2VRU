## New Features

* **Universal Melee**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Allows physical melee attacks with any weapon, or even with empty hands.
    - üõ†Ô∏è | Can be toggled in the *tweaks menu*, the damage can also be tuned as well.

<p></p>

* **Physical Jumping**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Translates physical jumping into in-game jumping.
    - üõ†Ô∏è | Can be toggled in the *controls menu*.
    - üõ†Ô∏è | Jumping threshold can be tweaked via the `hlvr_control_physical_jump_threshold` CVar.

<p></p>

* **Dual Wielding**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Allows each hand to independently equip and operate a weapon.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è | Requires the following actions to be bound on *both* controllers in the SteamVR bindings menu:
        - `"Fire"`, `"Alt Fire"`, `"Eject Magazine"`, `"Open Weapon Selection"`.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è | It is recommended to rebind `"Toggle Menu"` to be a long press or chord to not interfere with left hand `"Alt Fire"`.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è | It is also recommended to unbind `"Sprint"` on the left hand, as that is the most natural bind for weapon selection. Sprinting is still possible by double-tapping the joystick.
    - üõà | Obtaining a weapon makes it usable by both hands. E.g., as soon as you collect the crowbar, you'll be able to dual wield crowbars.

<p></p>

* **Virtual Stock**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Interpolates two-handed aiming with the player's approximate shoulder position, giving more stability when aiming down sights.
    - üõ†Ô∏è | Can be toggled in the *tweaks menu*, where also the shoulder position can be tuned.

<p></p>

* **Grip-Holster Mode**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Automatically holsters weapons when the grip is released, and equips the last holstered weapon when the grip is held.
    - üõà | Any hand interaction (e.g. grabbing a prop, using the flashlight) takes priority over equipping the last holstered weapon.
    - üõà | This is the recommended setting when dual wielding, as it simplifies the reloading process for two weapons a lot.
    - üõà | Helps to quickly interact with the world (e.g. collect an item, climb a ladder) without having to open the weapon selection menu.
    - üõà | Compatible with the *"Toggle grab"* option, that, if enabled, will require simply pressing the grip button rather than keeping it held.
    - üõ†Ô∏è | Can be toggled in the *controls menu*, where the related *"Toggle grab"* option can also be tuned.

<p></p>

* **Difficulty Tweaks**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Allows fine-tuning of damage, recoil, and bullet spread.
    - üõà | Both inflicted and taken damage can be tuned, allowing a more deadly and intense (i.e. no bullet sponges) yet fair experience.
    - üõà | It is recommended to reduce the recoil multiplier a bit to make dual wielding automatic weapons more enjoyable. 
    - üõ†Ô∏è | Can be tuned in the *tweaks menu*.
 
<p></p>

* **Miscellaneous**
    - ‚û°Ô∏è | Manually tweaked the offset of every weapon to keep the player's hand in the same position, improving aiming consistency.
